* Add to github and to planet
** Add more examples
** Add examples with higher abstraction levels
** Update readme

* Automatic type conversion
- don't bother with the many types
- define "standard" types
- allow usage of raw api too, to force a type?

* Provide raw C-API
- more or less done?
- need to double check

* Develop high-level API (based on python, c++)

* Add a racketify macro (convert "_" into "-")
- no need

* Add and test modules one by one
- too much work, test the essentials

* TODO Pre-make result buffers for each function that needs those
- is not always possible
- breaks the official API
