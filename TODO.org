* TODO
** TODO Develop high-level API (based on python, c++)
** TODO High-level types
** Add examples with higher abstraction levels
** Automatic type conversion
- don't bother with the many types
- define "standard" types
- allow usage of raw api too, to force a type?
** Add documentation
- It's a waste of time for the raw C interface
- I will add documentation after the high-level API is developed

* FINISHED
** DONE Add to github and to planet
** DONE Provide raw C-API
* DEFERRED
** DONE Add a racketify macro (convert "_" into "-")
- I like the underscores, because the examples in C can be converted into unsafe Racket almost 1:1
** DONE Add and test modules one by one
- too much work, test the essentials
- better, convert some examples from C

** DONE Pre-make result buffers for each function that needs those
- is not always possible
- breaks the official API
